I am a second year graduate student at Rice University. I am advised by [Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/), and I collaborate heavily with [Dr. Christopher Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/), [Dr.  Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) of UW-Madison, [Dr. Geoffrey Hautier](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/hautiergroup/), [Dr. George Phillips](https://www.phillipslab.org), and [Dr. Mitchell Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=waude4cAAAAJ&hl=en). Broadly my work focuses on the development of Neural Networks (NNs), though recent projects have been in physical science applications. 

Specifically, I focus on how the underlying mathematics of the application domain compare to those of the learning algorithm, and how this comparison can lead to best design and use practices for NN algorithms. Additonally, due to the nature of the learning for physical sciences domain, a substantial part of my work is in cross-department collaboration and data curation. 

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, rock climbing, and reading fiction novels with extensive backstories. I also particularly enjor cooking and (sometimes) eating creative recipes. 

*I recently started writing some explanatory articles covering detailed mathematics of machine learning. Check it out!*
