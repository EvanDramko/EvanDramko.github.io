I am a second year graduate student at Rice University. I am advised by [Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/), and I work closely with [Dr. Christopher Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/), [Dr.  Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) of UW-Madison, [Dr. Geoffrey Hautier](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/hautiergroup/), [Dr. George Phillips](https://www.phillipslab.org), and [Dr. Mitchell Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=waude4cAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focuses on two areas: 1) the development of **novel Neural Network (NN) architectures**, and 2) applying NNs to the physical sciences, specifically developing **Transformer-based architectures** for atomistic structural calculations in **nanoengineering** and **biochemistry**. 

Throughout my work I focus on the underlying mathematics of the application domain and customizing the NN architecure to match the application more closely. Additionally, due to the nature of the ML for physical sciences domain, a substantial part of my work in that area is in cross-departmental collaboration and in data curation. 

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, rock climbing, and reading fiction novels with extensive backstories. I also particularly enjoy cooking and (sometimes) eating creative recipes. 

*I recently started writing some explanatory articles covering the detailed mathematics of machine learning. Check it out!*
