I am a software engineering PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/) and work with [Dr. Edward Schwartz](https://edmcman.github.io/) at the [CMU Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/).
My work is in **AI/ML**, **program analysis**, and software **security**.
In particular, I focus on NLP and reverse engineering.

A major theme of my recent work has been studying and building an ecosystem of software tools in support of neural decompilation.
Decompilers convert compiled programs back into source code; neural decompilation enhances decompilation with machine learning to make the painstaking process of reverse engineering easier.
In particular, in my work, I have:
- Built state-of-the-art neural-decompilers. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04536))
- Designed a new multifaceted paradigm-shifting evaluation technique to measure neural decompilers' correctness and their value added over traditional decompilers. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04811))
- Systematically motivated the need for neural decompilation. ([paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec23winter-prepub-381-dramko.pdf))
- Studied dataset quality and best practices for dataset construction. A machine learning model is only as good as its training data. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04536), [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3546946))

Outside of neural decompilation, I have interned at [GitHub](https://github.com/), served on CMU's [REU-SE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) admissions comittee, and reviewed for [ACM TOSEM](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem).
